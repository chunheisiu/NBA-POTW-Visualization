### Introduction
#### 3-Minute Story
There exists a common belief that one's performance and experience dictate one's compensation. In this project, we aim to tackle this belief by examining a number of datasets related to NBA Players, in particular, **Player Statistics**, **Player Salary**, **Player of the Week**, and **Most Valuable Player of the Year (MVP)**. Based on these datasets, we want to know if a better NBA player, based on a range of game statistics, is more likely to be named the Player of the Week or to receive the MVP award, compared to those who underperform. Meanwhile, we also want to know if Players of the Week or MVP's would receive a higher salary compared to those who do not receive any awards or honors. Based on these findings, we could measure the influence of awards and performances on an NBA player's salary.

On the other hand, we all say basketball is a team game but does that reflect reality in the world of the NBA? To answer that, we seek the relationship between the best players and the best team. If a team is made up of the best players, how likely is it for the team to win the championship? Can a team with no â€œdream" players still be the champion? Based on these findings, we could determine if and how the performance of a team with one best player compared to a team with a few better players.

#### Big Idea
NBA is not a place we can always observe the magic power of teamwork, but a place we can usually witness the talented, whose compensation also reflects their true value, lead the game.
